# Document Scanner
Images of document taken by mobile phones are not always readable. Here I tried to make the image quality better, more like a scanning.

# Still shity, Will update it on time to time

# Step 1: install the dependecies using pip install -r requirements.txt
# Step 2: run python scan.py --folder {folder name of the images}

After showing an image, program will be paused, press a button on the keyboard to continue.
